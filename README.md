# Klipper Config for my Ender 3 Pro

The file `printer.cfg` is the current configuration I use for my [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/) setup.  
Maybe this is helpful for someone with a similar setup.

For information on how to configure Klipper check their official [documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html)
